## [Automated Video Subtitling on AWS](https://github.com/Sampaio-Vitor/automated-video-subtitling) 🎥📝

**About the Project:**  
Unveiling the fusion of AWS services and Docker to automate video subtitling! This project harnesses the power of AWS Lambda, S3, ECR, and Fargate to create an end-to-end pipeline. Whenever a video is uploaded to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function springs into action, triggering a Docker container in ECR to generate subtitles, courtesy of Fargate. This seamless integration not only automates the process but also scales efficiently to handle videos of any size.

- **Workflow Automation:** Streamlines the subtitling process from video upload to subtitle generation.
- **Tech Stack:** Leverages AWS Lambda, S3, ECR, Fargate, and Docker for a robust, scalable solution.
- **Practical Application:** Perfect for platforms where users can upload videos and receive them subtitled automatically, enhancing accessibility and viewer engagement.
