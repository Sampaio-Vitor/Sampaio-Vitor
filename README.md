### Hi there 👋🏽, I am Vitor Sampaio!

I'm a Data Scientist with over 4 years of rich experience, honed at Vale, in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights using both supervised and unsupervised ML techniques. My proficiency extends to AWS and GCP for ML deployment. Beyond my contributions at Vale, I've taken my passion for Data Science to personal projects, some of which are showcased here. I also share my insights on Medium.

🔍 Highlighted Project:

## [Apepreve.lat](https://github.com/Sampaio-Vitor/projeto_olx) 🏠

**About the Project:**  
Apepreve.lat is an end-to-end machine learning platform developed to analyze apartment listings in Brazil. It's designed to provide insights into whether a listing offers a good deal based on predictive analytics. You can access the website through [apepreve.lat](http://www.apepreve.lat/) Maybe your dream home is listed today with an incredible deal 👀

- **End-to-end ML Analysis:** Analyzing apartment deals from OLX Brazil.
- **Tech Stack:** Uses AWS, Selenium, XGBoost, Flask, and Docker for data flow & predictions. GitHub Actions and Docker for CICD.
- **Ongoing Work:** Continual enhancements underway for UI, data storage, and MLOps practices.

## [Data Jobs Positions Classifier](https://github.com/Sampaio-Vitor/webscraper.classifier) 💼🔍

**About the Project:**  
Ever wished job hunting on LinkedIn could be more personalized? This platform is tailored for that! Every day, it dives into LinkedIn, fetches new data job positions, and sends out a curated email with the top roles you'd love, ranked by relevance. Built with a foundation of 400 pre-selected listings, it uses the power of XGBoost to sequence job positions perfectly for the user.

- **Automated Insights:** Daily job discoveries from LinkedIn sent straight to your inbox.
- **ML Excellence:** Trained with 400 listings and refined with XGBoost to prioritize roles.
- **Tech Arsenal:** Skillfully constructed using Python, XGBoost, sk-learn, pandas, numpy, and beautifulsoup. All hosted on AWS using EC2 and S3.

Your job hunt, now smarter and tailored for you.

## [Salary Analysis with OLS](https://github.com/Sampaio-Vitor/your-repo-link-here) 💹📊

**About the Project:**  
Ever wondered how factors like education, job position, and location impact salary? Dive deep with this project! Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, I've distilled the essence of these relationships. This isn't about mere predictions; it's a deep dive into statistical inference.

- **Objective:** Unravel significant factors influencing salary.
- **Data Depth:** Comprehensive dataset with attributes like education, job role, and locale.
- **Tech & Tools:** Statistical techniques, data preprocessing, and OLS regression.
